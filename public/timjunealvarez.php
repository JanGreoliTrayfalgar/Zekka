BSIT 

I learned that setting up git for the first time is hard, but once you actually start having a hands-on it becomes easy to use.
also learnd how to copy or clone from different platforms, know how to switch or create a branch. also learnd what i should not 
do or avoid like pushing first with out pulling that can be a problem. by not changing from a different branch or else i could overwrite
the main and potentially distory the main code.
